nodogsplash (5.0.2)

* Fix crash if query string is too long.

 -- Moritz Warning <moritzwarning@web.de>  Tue, 10 Oct 2023 12:02:20 +0000

nodogsplash (5.0.1)

* fix path traversal security issue
* add session_limit_block feature
    The session_limit_block is similiar to session_timeout_block,
    but instead of limiting the time, it limits the traffic.
    The session_limit_block allows to limit a user to a certain
    amount of traffic before the user will be blocked from applying again.
* add session_timeout_block feature
    The session_timeout_block config allows end and block
    a session after a certain timeout. E.g. allows to limit a
    user to have internet connectivity for 20 minutes and not allowing
    to apply again.
* Introduce variable gw_http_name/port
    gw_http_name holds the http hostname and port in the correct
    representation to work with it. Saves sprintf calls for every
    connection.
