.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
\fBNoDogSplash\fP (NDS) is a high performance, small footprint Captive Portal, offering by default a simple splash page restricted Internet connection, yet incorporates an API that allows the creation of sophisticated authentication applications.
.SS Captive Portal Detection (CPD)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
All modern mobile devices, most desktop operating systems and most browsers now have a CPD process that automatically issues a port 80 request on connection to a network. NDS detects this and serves a special "\fBsplash\fP" web page to the connecting client device.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Provide simple and immediate public Internet access
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
NDS provides two pre\-installed methods.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBClick to Continue\fP\&. A simple static web page with template variables (\fIdefault\fP). This provides basic notification and a simple click/tap to continue button.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBusername/email\-address login\fP\&. A simple dynamic set of web pages that provide username/email\-address login, a welcome page and logs access by client users. (\fIInstalled by default and enabled by un\-commenting a line in the configuration file\fP)
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
NDS can be used as the "Engine" behind the most sophisticated Captive Portal systems using the tools provided.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBForward Authentication Service (FAS)\fP\&. FAS provides pre\-authentication user validation in the form of a set of dynamic web pages, typically served by a web service independent of NDS, located remotely on the Internet, on the local area network or on the NDS router.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPreAuth\fP\&. A special case of FAS that runs locally on the NDS router with dynamic html served by NDS itself. This requires none of the overheads of a full FAS implementation and is ideal for NDS routers with limited RAM and Flash memory.

.SH INSTALLING NODOGSPLASH
.SS OpenWrt
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Have a router working with OpenWrt. At the time of writing, Nodogsplash has been tested with OpenWrt 18.06.x, 19.7.x and Snapshot.
.IP \(bu 2
It may or may not work on older versions of OpenWrt or on other kinds of Linux\-based router firmware.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure your router is basically working before you try to install  Nodogsplash. In particular, make sure your DHCP daemon is serving addresses on the interface that nodogsplash will manage.
.sp
The default is br\-lan but can be changed to any interface by editing the /etc/config/nodogsplash file.
.IP \(bu 2
To install Nodogsplash, you may use the OpenWrt Luci web interface or alternatively, ssh to your router and run the command:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBopkg update\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
followed by
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBopkg install nodogsplash\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Nodogsplash is enabled by default and will start automatically on reboot or can be started and stopped manually.
.IP \(bu 2
If the interface that you want Nodogsplash to manage is not br\-lan,
edit /etc/config/nodogsplash and set GatewayInterface.
.IP \(bu 2
To start Nodogsplash, run the following, or just reboot the router:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBservice nodogsplash start\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
To test the installation, connect a client device to the interface on your router that is managed by Nodogsplash (for example, connect to the router\(aqs wireless lan).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Most client device operating systems and browsers support Captive Portal Detection (CPD) and the operating system or browser on that device will attempt to contact a pre defined port 80 web page.
.sp
CPD will trigger Nodogsplash to serve the default splash page where you can click or tap Continue to access the Internet.
.sp
See the Authentication section for details of setting up a proper authentication process.
.sp
If your client device does not display the splash page it most likely does not support CPD.
.sp
You should then manually trigger Nodogsplash by trying to access a port 80 web site (for example, google.com:80 is a good choice).

.SH HOW NODOGSPLASH (NDS) WORKS
.sp
NoDogSplash is a Captive Portal Engine. Any Captive Portal, including NDS, will have two main components:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Something that does the capturing, and
.IP \(bu 2
Something to provide a Portal for client users to log in.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A wireless router will typically be running OpenWrt or some other Linux distribution.
.sp
A router, by definition, will have two or more interfaces, at least one to connect to the wide area network (WAN) or Internet feed, and at least one connecting to the local area network (LAN).
.sp
Each LAN interface must also act as the Default IP Gateway for its LAN, ideally with the interface serving IP addresses to client devices using DHCP.
.sp
Multiple LAN interfaces can be combined into a single bridge interface. For example, ethernet, 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks are typically combined into a single bridge interface. Logical interface names will be assigned such as eth0, wlan0, wlan1 etc. with the combined bridge interface named as br\-lan.
.sp
NDS will manage one or more of them of them. This will typically be br\-lan, the bridge to both the wireless and wired LAN, but could be, for example, wlan0 if you wanted NDS to work just on the wireless interface.
.SS Summary of Operation
.sp
By default, NDS blocks everything, but intercepts port 80 requests.
.sp
An initial port 80 request will be generated on a client device, usually automatically by the client device\(aqs built in Captive Portal Detection (CPD), or possibly by the user manually browsing to an http web page.
.sp
This request will of course \fBbe routed by the client device to the Default Gateway\fP of the local network. The Default Gateway will, as we have seen, be the router interface that NDS is managing.
.SS The Thing That Does the Capturing
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
As soon as this initial port 80 request is received on the default gateway interface, NDS will "Capture" it, make a note of the client device identity, allocate a unique token for the client device, then redirect the client browser to the Portal component of NDS.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS The Thing That Provides the Portal
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The client browser is redirected to the Portal component. This is a web service that is configured to know how to communicate with the core engine of NDS.
.sp
This is commonly known as the Splash Page.
.sp
NDS has its own web server built in and this can be used to serve the Portal "Splash" pages to the client browser, or a separate web server can be used.
.sp
NDS comes with two standard Splash Page options pre\-installed.
.sp
One provides a trivial Click to Continue splash page with template variables and the other provides a Client User form requiring Name and Email address to be entered.
.sp
Both of these can be customised or a complete specialised Portal can be written by the installer (See FAS, PreAuth).
.sp
FAS, or Forward Authentication Service may use the web server embedded in NDS, a separate web server installed on the NDS router, a web server residing on the local network or an Internet hosted web server.
.sp
The user of the client device will always be expected to complete some actions on the splash page.
.sp
Once the user on the client device has successfully completed the splash page actions, that page then links directly back to NDS.
.sp
For security, NDS expects to receive the same valid token it allocated when the client issued its initial port 80 request. If the token received is valid, NDS then "authenticates" the client device, allowing access to the Internet.
.sp
Post authentication processing extensions may be added to NDS (See BinAuth). Once NDS has received a valid token it calls a BinAuth script.
.sp
If the BinAuth script returns positively (ie return code 0), NDS then "authenticates" the client device, allowing access to the Internet.
.sp
Where FAS is used, secure modes are provided (levels 1 and 2), where the client token and other required variables are kept securely hidden from the Client, ensuring verification cannot be bypassed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
FAS and Binauth can be enabled together. This can give great flexibility, with FAS providing remote verification and Binauth providing local post authentication processing closely linked to  NDS.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Captive Portal Detection (CPD)
.sp
All modern mobile devices, most desktop operating systems and most browsers now have a CPD process that automatically issues a port 80 request on connection to a network. NDS detects this and serves a special “splash” web page to the connecting client device.
.sp
The port 80 html request made by the client CPD can be one of many vendor specific URLs.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Typical CPD URLs used are, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIhttp://captive.apple.com/hotspot\-detect.html\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fIhttp://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com/generate_204\fP

.IP \(bu 2
\fIhttp://detectportal.firefox.com/success.txt\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Plus many more
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is important to remember that CPD is designed primarily for mobile devices to automatically detect the presence of a portal and to trigger the login page, without having to resort to breaking SSL/TLS security by requiring the portal to redirect port 443 for example.
.sp
Just about all current CPD implementations work very well but some compromises are necessary depending on the application.
.sp
The vast majority of devices attaching to a typical Captive Portal are mobile devices. CPD works well giving the initial login page.
.sp
For a typical guest wifi, eg a coffee shop, bar, club, hotel etc., a device connects, the Internet is accessed for a while, then the user takes the device out of range.
.sp
When taken out of range, a typical mobile device begins periodically polling the wireless spectrum for SSIDs that it knows about to try to obtain a connection again, subject to timeouts to preserve battery life.
.sp
Most Captive Portals have a session duration limit (NDS included).
.sp
If a previously logged in device returns to within the coverage of the portal, the previously used SSID is recognised and CPD is triggered and tests for an Internet connection in the normal way. Within the session duration limit of the portal, the Internet connection will be established, if the session has expired, the splash page will be displayed again.
.sp
Early mobile device implementations of CPD used to poll their detection URL at regular intervals, typically around 30 to 300 seconds. This would trigger the Portal splash page quite quickly if the device stayed in range and the session limit had been reached.
.sp
However it was very quickly realised that this polling kept the WiFi on the device enabled continuously having a very negative effect on battery life, so this polling whilst connected was either increased to a very long interval or removed all together (depending on vendor) to preserve battery charge. As most mobile devices come and go into and out of range, this is not an issue.
.sp
A common issue raised is:
.sp
\fIMy devices show the splash page when they first connect, but when the authorization expires, they just announce there is no internet connection. I have to make them "forget" the wireless network to see the splash page again. Is this how is it supposed to work?\fP
.sp
The workaround is as described in the issue, or even just manually disconnecting or turning WiFi off and on will simulate a "going out of range", initialising an immediate trigger of the CPD. One or any combination of these workarounds should work, again depending on the particular vendor\(aqs implementation of CPD.
.sp
In contrast, most laptop/desktop operating systems, and browser versions for these still implement CPD polling whilst online as battery considerations are not so important.
.sp
For example, Gnome desktop has its own built in CPD browser with a default interval of 300 seconds. Firefox also defaults to something like 300 seconds. Windows 10 is similar.
.sp
This IS how it is supposed to work, but does involve some compromises.
.sp
The best solution is to set the session timeout to a value greater than the expected length of time a client device is likely to be present. Experience shows a limit of 24 hours covers most situations eg bars, clubs, coffee shops, motels etc. If for example an hotel has guests regularly staying for a few days, then increase the session timeout as required.
.sp
Staff at the venue could have their devices added to the Trusted List if appropriate, but experience shows, it is better not to do this as they very soon learn what to do and can help guests who encounter the issue. (Anything that reduces support calls is good!)
.SS Packet filtering
.sp
Nodogsplash considers four kinds of packets coming into the router over the managed interface. Each packet is one of these kinds:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
\fBBlocked\fP, if the MAC mechanism is block, and the source MAC address of the packet matches one listed in the BlockedMACList; or if the MAC mechanism is allow, and source MAC address of the packet does not match one listed in the AllowedMACList or the TrustedMACList. These packets are dropped.
.IP 2. 3
\fBTrusted\fP, if the source MAC address of the packet matches one listed in the TrustedMACList. By default, these packets are accepted and routed to all destination addresses and ports. If desired, this behavior can be customized by FirewallRuleSet trusted\-users and FirewallRuleSet trusted\-users\-to\-router lists in the nodogsplash.conf configuration file, or by the EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted\-users EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted\-users\-to\-router directives.
.IP 3. 3
\fBAuthenticated\fP, if the packet\(aqs IP and MAC source addresses have gone through the nodogsplash authentication process and has not yet expired. These packets are accepted and routed to a limited set of addresses and ports (see FirewallRuleSet authenticated\-users and FirewallRuleSet users\-to\-router in the nodogsplash.conf configuration file).
.IP 4. 3
\fBPreauthenticated\fP\&. Any other packet. These packets are accepted and routed to a limited set of addresses and ports (see FirewallRuleSet      preauthenticated\-users and FirewallRuleSet users\-to\-router in the nodogsplash.conf configuration file). Any other packet is dropped, except that a packet for destination port 80 at any address is redirected to port 2050 on the router, where nodogsplash\(aqs built in libhttpd\-based web server is listening. This begins the \(aqauthentication\(aq process. The server will serve a splash page back to the source IP address of the packet. The user clicking the appropriate link on the splash page will complete the process, causing future packets from this IP/MAC address to be marked as Authenticated until the inactive or forced timeout is reached, and its packets revert to being Preauthenticated.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
NoDogSplash implements these actions by inserting rules in the router\(aqs iptables mangle PREROUTING chain to mark packets, and by inserting rules in the nat PREROUTING, filter INPUT and filter FORWARD chains which match on those marks.
.sp
Because it inserts its rules at the beginning of existing chains, NoDogSplash should be insensitive to most typical existing firewall configurations.
.SS Traffic control
.sp
Data rate control on an IP connection basis can be achieved using Smart Queue Management (SQM) configured separately, with NDS being fully compatible.
.sp
It should be noted that while setup options and BinAuth do accept traffic/quota settings, these values currently have no effect and are reserved for future development.
.SH THE SPLASH PAGE
.sp
As you will see mentioned in the "How Nodogsplash (NDS) Works" section, an initial port 80 request is generated on a client device, either by the user manually browsing to an http web page, or, more usually, automatically by the client device\(aqs built in Captive Portal Detection (CPD).
.sp
This request is intercepted by NDS and an html Splash Page is served to the user of the client device to enable them to authenticate and obtain Internet access.
.SS Types of Splash Page
.sp
This Splash page can be one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA Static Web Page served by NDS:\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A page generated from the basic splash.html file installed with NDS and includes Template Variables (as listed in the splash.html file). \fIThis is the default configuration of a fresh installation of NDS.\fP
.sp
A script or executable file can optionally be called by NDS for post authentication processing (see \fBBinAuth\fP).
.sp
An example of the use of BinAuth is to check the Username and Password entered by a user into an authentication form supplied by the splash page.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA Dynamic Web Page served by NDS\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A script or executable file is called by NDS immediately (without serving splash.html). The called script or executable will generate html code for NDS to serve in place of splash.html. (see \fBPreAuth\fP).
.sp
This enables a dialogue with the client user, for dissemination of information, user response and authentication.
.sp
This is implemented using \fBFAS\fP, but \fIwithout the resource utilisation of a separate web server\fP, particularly useful for legacy devices with limited flash and RAM capacity.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBA Dynamic Web Page served by an independent web server\fP on the same device as NDS, on the same Local Area Network as NDS, or on External Web Hosting Services.
.sp
A script or executable file is called by NDS immediately (without serving splash.html). The called script or executable will generate html code to be served by an independent Web Server. (see FAS).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This not only enables a dialogue with the client user, for dissemination of information, user response and authentication but also full flexibility in design and implementation of the captive portal functionality from a self contained system through to, for example, a fully integrated multi site system with a common database.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS The Two Installed Basic Splash Pages
.sp
By default, two fully functional but basic "Splash" pages are installed. Simple config options allow you to choose which one to use.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The Simple "Click to Continue" splash page. (Default)
.IP \(bu 2
The "Username/Email\-address" Login script.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fISee the chapter on PreAuth for details on how to switch between these splash page types.\fP
.sp
In many instances, one or other of these simple methods will be all that is required, but the power of FAS, PreAuth and BinAuth can be used to create very sophisticated Captive Portal Systems.
.SS Displaying Remote Content
.sp
FASand PreAuth can be used to display remote content on the client user login screen.
This is ideal for serving information, banner advertising etc.
.sp
An example is described in the \fBDisplaying Remote Banner Images\fP
section of the PreAuth chapter.
.SH FORWARDING AUTHENTICATION SERVICE (FAS)
.SS Overview
.sp
Nodogsplash (NDS) has the ability to forward requests to a third party authentication service (FAS). This is enabled via simple configuration options.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B These options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
\fBfasport\fP\&. This enables Forwarding Authentication Service (FAS). Redirection is changed from splash.html to a FAS. The value is the IP port number of the FAS.
.IP 2. 3
\fBfasremoteip\fP\&. If set, this is the remote ip address of the FAS, if not set it will take the value of the NDS gateway address.
.IP 3. 3
\fBfasremotefqdn\fP If set, this is the remote fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the FAS
.IP 4. 3
\fBfaspath\fP\&. This is the path from the FAS Web Root (not the file system root) to the FAS login page.
.IP 5. 3
\fBfas_secure_enable\fP\&. This can have three values, "0", "1", or "2" providing different levels of security.
.IP 6. 3
\fBfaskey\fP Used in combination with fas_secure_enable level 2, this is a key phrase for NDS to encrypt the query string sent to FAS.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
FAS (and Preauth/FAS) enables pre authentication processing. NDS authentication is the process that NDS uses to allow a client device to access the Internet through the Firewall. In contrast, Forward Authentication is a process of "Credential Verification", after which FAS, if the verification process is successful, passes the client token to NDS for access to the Internet to be granted.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using FAS
.sp
\fBNote\fP:
All addresses (with the exception of fasremoteip) are relative to the \fIclient\fP device, even if the FAS is located remotely.
.sp
When FAS is enabled, NDS automatically configures firewall access to the FAS service.
.sp
The FAS service must serve an http splash of its own to replace the NDS splash.html.
.sp
Typically, the FAS service will be written in PHP or any other language that can provide dynamic web content.
.sp
FAS can then provide an action form for the client, typically requesting login, or self account creation for login.
.sp
The FAS can be on the same device as NDS, on the same local area network as NDS, or on an Internet hosted web server.
.SS Security
.sp
\fBIf FAS Secure is enabled\fP (Levels 1 (default), and 2), the client authentication token is kept secret until FAS verification is complete.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBIf set to "0"\fP the client token is sent to the FAS in clear text in the query string of the redirect along with authaction and redir.
.sp
\fBIf set to "1"\fP When the sha256sum command is available AND faskey is set, the client token will be hashed and sent to the FAS identified as "hid" in the query string. The gatewayaddress is also sent on the query string, allowing the FAS to construct the authaction parameter. FAS must return the sha256sum of the concatenation of the original hid and faskey to be used by NDS for client authentication. This is returned in the normal way in the query string identified as "tok". NDS will automatically detect whether hid mode is active or the raw token is being returned.
.sp
Should sha256sum not be available or faskey is not set, then it is the responsibility of the FAS to request the token from NDSCTL.
.sp
\fBIf set to "2"\fP
clientip, clientmac, gatewayname, client token, gatewayaddress, authdir and originurl are encrypted using faskey and passed to FAS in the query string.
.sp
The query string will also contain a randomly generated initialization vector to be used by the FAS for decryption.
.sp
The cipher used is "AES\-256\-CBC".
.sp
The "php\-cli" package and the "php\-openssl" module must both be installed for fas_secure level 2.
.sp
Nodogsplash does not depend on this package and module, but will exit gracefully if this package and module are not installed when this level is set.
.sp
The FAS must use the query string passed initialisation vector and the pre shared fas_key to decrypt the query string. An example FAS level 2 php script is preinstalled in the /etc/nodogsplash directory and also supplied in the source code.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBOption faskey must be set\fP if fas secure is set to level 2 but is optional for level 1.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Option faskey is used to encrypt the data sent by NDS to FAS.
It can be any combination of A\-Z, a\-z and 0\-9, up to 16 characters with no white space.
.sp
This is used to create a sha256 digest that is in turn used to encrypt the data using the aes\-256\-cbc cypher.
.sp
A random initialisation vector is generated for every encryption and sent to FAS with the encrypted data.
.sp
Option faskey must be pre\-shared with FAS.
.UNINDENT

\fBLevel 1\fP (fas_secure_enabled = 1), NDS sends only information required to identify, the instance of NDS, the client and the client\(aqs originally requested URL.
.sp
\fBIf faskey is set\fP, NDS sends a digest of the random client token:
.sp
\fIhttp://fasremotefqdn:fasport/faspath?hid=[hash_id]&gatewayname=[gatewayname]&clientip=[clientip]&redir=[requested\-url]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The FAS must return the hash of the concatenated hid value and the value of faskey identified in the query string as "tok". NDS will automatically detect this.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBIf faskey is not set\fP the following is sent:
.sp
\fIhttp://fasremotefqdn:fasport/faspath?gatewayname=[gatewayname]&clientip=[clientip]&redir=[requested\-url]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
It is the responsibility of FAS to obtain the unique client token allocated by NDS as well as constructing the return URL to NDS.
.sp
The return url will be constructed by FAS from predetermined knowledge of the configuration of NDS using gatewayname as an identifier.
.sp
The client\(aqs unique access token will be obtained from NDS by the FAS making a call to the ndsctl tool.
.sp
For example, the following command returns just the token:
.sp
\fIndsctl json $clientip | grep token | cut \-c 10\- | cut \-c \-8\fP
.sp
A more sophisticated json parser could be used to extract all the client variables supplied by ndsctl, an example can be found in the default PreAuth Login script in /usr/lib/nogogsplash/login.sh.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBLevel 2\fP (fas_secure_enabled = 2), NDS sends enrypted information to FAS.
.sp
\fIhttp://fasremotefqdn:fasport/faspath?fas=[aes\-256\-cbc data]&iv=[random initialisation vector]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
It is the responsibility of FAS to decrypt the aes\-256\-cbc data it receives, using the pre shared faskey and the random initialisation vector.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The decrypted string received by FAS will be of the form:
[varname1]=[var1], [varname2]=[var2], ..... etc. (the separator being comma\-space).
.sp
eg \fIclientip=192.168.8.23, clientmac=04:15:52:6a:e4:ad, tok=770bfe05, originurl=.....\fP
.sp
Variables sent by NDS in the encrypted string in NDS v4.0.0 are as follows:
.sp
\fBclientip clientmac gatewayname tok gatewayaddress authdir originurl\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Where:
\fBtok\fP is the client token
.sp
\fBgatewayaddress\fP is authentication address of NDS ie [nds_ip]:[nds_port]
.sp
\fBauthdir\fP is the NDS virtual authentication directory
.UNINDENT
.sp
Future versions of NDS may send additional variables and the order of the variables in the decrypted string may also vary, so it is the responsiblity of FAS to parse the decrypted string for the variables it requires.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS After Successful Verification by FAS
.sp
If the client is successfully verified by the FAS, FAS will return the unique token, or its hashed equivalent to NDS to finally allow the client access to the Internet.
.SS Post FAS processing
.sp
Once the client has been authenticated by the FAS, NDS must then be informed to allow the client to have access to the Internet.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This is done by accessing NDS at a special virtual URL.
.sp
This virtual URL is of the form:
.sp
\fIhttp://[nds_ip]:[nds_port]/[authdir]/?tok=[token]&redir=[landing_page_url]\fP
.sp
This is most commonly achieved using an html form of method GET.
The parameter redir can be the client\(aqs originally requested URL sent by NDS, or more usefully, the URL of a suitable landing page.
.sp
Be aware that many client CPD processes will \fBautomatically close\fP the landing page as soon as Internet access is detected.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS BinAuth Post FAS Processing
.sp
As BinAuth can be enabled at the same time as FAS, a BinAuth script may be used for custom post FAS processing. (see BinAuth).
.SS Manual Access of NDS Virtual URL
.sp
If the user of an already authenticated client device manually accesses the NDS Virtual URL, they will be redirected back to FAS with the "status" query string.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This will be of the form:
.sp
\fIhttp://fasremoteip:fasport/faspath?clientip=[clientip]&gatewayname=[gatewayname]&status=authenticated\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
FAS should then serve a suitable error page informing the client user that they are already logged in.

FAS has been tested using uhttpd, lighttpd, ngnix, apache and libmicrohttpd.
.sp
\fBRunning on OpenWrt with uhttpd/PHP\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A FAS service may run quite well on uhttpd (the web server that serves Luci) on an OpenWrt supported device with 8MB flash and 32MB ram but shortage of ram will be an issue if more than two or three clients log in at the same time.
.sp
For this reason a device with a minimum of 8MB flash and 64MB ram is recommended.
.sp
\fIAlthough port 80 is the default for uhttpd, it is reserved for Captive Portal Detection so cannot be used for FAS. uhttpd can however be configured to operate on more than one port.\fP
.sp
We will use port 2080 in this example.
.sp
Install the module php7\-cgi. Further modules may be required depending on your requirements.
.sp
To enable FAS with php in uhttpd you must add the lines:
.INDENT 0.0

.SH PREAUTH OPTION
.SS Overview
.sp
\fBPreAuth\fP is an implementation of FAS \fIwithout the resource utilisation of a separate web server\fP, particularly useful for legacy devices with limited flash and RAM capacity.
.sp
\fBPreAuth\fP is a pre\-authentication process that enables NDS to directly serve dynamic web content generated by a script or executable program.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
From version 3.3.1 onwards, a PreAuth login script is pre\-installed. This generates a page asking for username and email address. Logins are recorded in a log file. It is enabled by un\-commenting just 3 lines in the config file. \fBFrom version 4.0.2 onwards\fP it is enabled by a single line in the config file that overrides any other FAS configuration.  \fBFrom version 4.3.0 onwards\fP it is enabled by setting config option login_option_enabled to "1"
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBPreAuth is enabled\fP by configuring NDS FAS to point to a virtual URL in the NDS web root instead of an independent FAS server. The location of the PreAuth script or program is provided in the config file.
.sp
\fBThe PreAuth script\fP can be a shell script or any other script type that an interpreter is available for (for example, PHP\-cli, Python etc.).
.sp
A PreAuth program could be, for example, a compiled program written in C or any other language that has a compiler available for the platform.
.sp
The PreAuth script or program will parse the url encoded command line (query string) passed to it and output html depending on the contents of the query string it receives from NDS. In turn, NDS will serve this html to the client device that is attempting to access the Internet.
.SS Selecting Pre\-Installed Username / Email Login Script (v4.3.0 onwards)
.sp
The default preauth login script is installed as part of the NoDogSplash package providing username/emailaddress login as an alternative to the basic splash page.
.sp
It is enabled by setting in config:
.sp
option login_option_enabled = \(aq1\(aq
.sp
No additional FAS or PreAuth config settings are required.
.SS Using PreAuth version 4.0.2 onwards
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B From version 4.0.2 onwards, PreAuth is enabled with a single configuration option:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpreauth\fP\&. This the path to the PreAuth script or executable.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This option overrides any other FAS configuration and takes the form of the path to the PreAuth script.
The path to the preinstalled login script is included in option preauth in the default config files, for example in OpenWrt:
.sp
\fI#option preauth \(aq/usr/lib/nodogsplash/login.sh\(aq\fP
.sp
The "#" symbol means the line is commented. To activate, remove the "#". save and restart Nodogsplash.
.SS Using PreAuth version 3.3.1 to version 4.0.1
.sp
From version 3.3.1 to version 4.0.1, PreAuth is set up using the standard NDS configuration for FAS
(See the \fBForwarding Authentication Service (FAS)\fP section of this documentation).
.sp
In addition a single PreAuth configuration option is required to inform NDS of the location of the PreAuth script or program.
.INDENT 0.0

.SS What Does the Example Login Script Do?
.sp
\fBThis example shell script\fP generates html output for NDS to serve as a dynamic splash page.
.sp
The example asks the client user to enter their name and email address.
On entering this information the client user then clicks or taps "Continue".
.sp
The script then generates html code to send to NDS to serve a second "Thankyou" page and creates a log entry ( /tmp/ndslog.log ), recording the client authentication details.
.sp
On tapping "Continue" for the second time, the client user is given access to the Internet.
.sp
This is a simple example of a script to demonstrate how to use PreAuth as a built in FAS. The script could of course ask for any response from the client and conduct its own authentication procedures \- entirely at the discretion of the person setting up their own captive portal functionality.

.SS Writing A Preauth Script
.sp
A Preauth script can be written as a shell script or any other language that the system has an interpreter for. It could also be a complied program.
.sp
NDS calls the preauth script with a command line equivalent to an html query string but with ", " (comma space) in place of "&" (ampersand).

.SS Defining and Using Variables
.sp
The query string is sent to us from NDS in a urlencoded form, so we must decode it here so we can parse it. In a shell script we would use the code:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
query=$(printf "${query_enc//%/\e\ex}")
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the example script we want to ask the client user for their username and email address.
.sp
We could ask for anything we like and add our own variables to the html forms we generate.
.sp
If we want to show a sequence of forms or information pages we can do this easily.
.sp
To return to the script and show additional pages, the form action must be set to:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<form action=\e"/nodogsplash_preauth/\e" method=\e"get\e">
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note: In a shell script, quotes ( " ) must be escaped with the
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"\e"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
character.
.sp
Any variables we need to preserve and pass back to ourselves or NDS must be added to the form as hidden:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<input type=\e"hidden\e" name=......
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Such variables will appear in the query string when NDS re\-calls this script.
.sp
We can then parse for them again.
.sp
When the logic of this script decides we should allow the client to access the Internet we inform NDS with a final page displaying a continue button with the form action set to:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"<form action=\e"/nodogsplash_auth/\e" method=\e"get\e">"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We must also send NDS the client token as a hidden variable, but first we must obtain the token from ndsctl using a suitable command such as:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
tok="$(ndsctl json $clientip | grep token | cut \-c 10\- | cut \-c \-8)"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In a similar manner we can obtain any client or NDS information that ndsctl provides.
.sp
The query string NDS sends to us will always be of the following form (with a "comma space" separator):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
?clientip=[clientipaddress], gatewayname=[gatewayname],  redir=[originalurl], var4=[data], var5=[data], var6......
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first three variables will be clientip, gatewayname and redir
.sp
We have chosen to name redir as $requested here as it is actually the originally requested url.
.sp
There is one exception to this. If the client presses "back" on their browser NDS detects this and tells us by returning status=authenticated instead of redir=[originalurl]
.sp
If we detect this we show a page telling the client they are already logged in.
.sp
Additional variables returned by NDS will be those we define here and send to NDS via an html form method=get
.sp
See the example script which uses $username and $emailaddr
.sp
There is no limit to the number of variables we can define dynamically as long as the query string does not exceed 2048 bytes.
.sp
The query string will be truncated if it does exceed this length.
.SS Displaying Remote Banner Images
.sp
A modified version of the Username/Email\-address login script is available that demonstrates how to display remotely hosted images on its login pages.

.SH BINAUTH OPTION
.SS Overview
.sp
\fBBinAuth provides a method of running a post authentication script\fP or extension program. BinAuth is ALWAYS local to NDS and as such will have access to all the resources of the local system.
.sp
\fBBinAuth works with, but does not require FAS\fP and in a simple system can be used to provide site\-wide username/password access.
.sp
\fBWith FAS, the redir variable forwarded to BinAuth\fP can contain an embedded payload of custom variables defined by the FAS. As FAS is typically remote from the NDS router, this provides a link to the local system.
.sp
\fBBinAuth has the means to set a session timeout\fP interval on a client by client basis.

.SS Example 1 \- Sitewide Username/Password
.sp
This example is a script designed to be used with or without FAS and provides site wide Username/Password login for two groups of users, in this case "Staff" and "Guest" with two corresponding sets of credentials. If used without FAS, a special html splash page must be installed, otherwise FAS must forward the required username and password variables.
.sp
The "Staff" user is allowed access to the Internet for the full duration of the global sessiontimeout interval before being logged out.
.sp
The "Guest" user is allowed access for 10 minutes before being logged out.

       Nodogsplash (NDS), by default, serves this splash page (splash.html)
       when a client device Captive Portal Detection (CPD) process
       attempts to send a port 80 request to the Internet.

       You may either embed css in this file or use a separate .css file
       in the same directory as this file, as demonstrated here.

       It should be noted when designing a custom splash page
       that for security reasons many CPD implementations:
               Immediately close the browser when the client has authenticated.
               Prohibit the use of href links.
               Prohibit downloading of external files
                       (including .css and .js).
               Prohibit the execution of javascript.

Authentication:
       A client is authenticated on submitting an HTTP form, method=get,
       passing $authaction, $tok and $redir.

       It is also possible to authenticate using an href link to
       $authtarget but be aware that many device Captive Portal Detection
       processes prohibit href links, so this method may not work with
       all client devices.

Available variables:
       error_msg: $error_msg
       gatewayname: $gatewayname
       tok: $tok
       redir: $redir
       authaction: $authaction
       denyaction: $denyaction
       authtarget: $authtarget
       clientip: $clientip
       clientmac: $clientmac
       clientupload: $clientupload
       clientdownload: $clientdownload
       gatewaymac: $gatewaymac
       nclients: $nclients
       maxclients: $maxclients
       uptime: $uptime

Additional Variables that can be passed back via the HTTP get,
or appended to the query string of the authtarget link:
       username
       password

.SS Example 2 \- Local NDS Access Log
.sp
This example is a script designed to be used with or without FAS and provides local NDS logging. FAS is often remote from the NDS router and this script provides a simple method of interacting directly with the local NDS. FAS can provide the values of custom variables securly embedded as a payload in the redir parameter that is relayed to BinAuth by NDS. FAS can also utilise the username and password parameters to send general purpose variables although these will be readable by the client user on their browser screen.
.sp
The log file is stored by default in the /tmp/ directory but no free space checking is done in this simple example.
It would be a simple matter to change the location of the log file to a USB stick for example.
.SS Installing Example 2
.sp
This script has a single component, the shell script.

.sp
The file binauth_log.sh should be copied to a suitable location on the NDS router, eg \fI/etc/nodogsplash/\fP
.sp
Assuming FAS is not being used, NDS is then configured by setting the BinAuth option in the config file (/etc/config/nodogsplash on Openwrt, or /etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf on other operating systems.
.sp
On OpenWrt this is most easily accomplished by issuing the following commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIuci set nodogsplash.@nodogsplash[0].binauth=\(aq/etc/nodogsplash/binauth_log.sh\(aq\fP
.sp
\fIuci commit nodogsplash\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
\fIchmod u+x /etc/nodogsplash/binauth_log.sh\fP
.UNINDENT

This script is then activated with the command:

.SH TRAFFIC CONTROL
.SS Overview
.sp
Nodogsplash (NDS) supports Traffic Control (Bandwidth Limiting) using the SQM \- Smart Queue Management (sqm\-scripts) package, available for OpenWrt and generic Linux.
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/tohojo/sqm\-scripts\fP
.sp
SQM does efficient bandwidth control, independently for both upload and download, on an IP connection basis. This ideal for enforcing a fair usage policy on a typical Captive Portal implementation.
.sp
In addition the Queue management SQM provides, results in significantly improved WiFi performance, particularly on the modern low cost WiFi routers available on the market today.
.sp
Finally, SQM controls quality of service (QOS), allowing priority for real time protocols such a VOIP.
.sp
Overall, SQM can enhance significantly the experience of clients using your Captive Portal, whilst ensuring a single client is unlikely to dominate the available Internet service at the expense of others.
.SS Installing SQM
.sp
The generic Linux scripts can be downloaded from the link above.
.sp
\fBOn OpenWrt\fP, SQM can be installed from the LuCi interface or by the following CLI commands on your router:
.sp
\fIopkg update\fP
.sp
\fIopkg install sqm\-scripts\fP
.sp
\fBNote\fP:
The standard and default SQM installation expects monitoring of the interface connecting to the WAN. What we need is for SQM to monitor the interface NDS is bound to. This of course will be a LAN interface.
The default configuration will limit bandwidth from the WAN connection to services on the Internet. Our configuration will limit client bandwidth TO NDS, thus enabling a true fair usage policy.
.sp
\fITo prevent confusion\fP it is important to understand that SQM defines "Upload" as traffic "Out" of the interface SQM is monitoring and "Download" as traffic "In" to the SQM interface.
.sp
In the default SQM configuration, Upload will mean what is normally accepted, ie traffic to the Internet and Download will mean traffic from the Internet.
.sp
\fBIn our case however the terms will be reversed!\fP
.sp
The default SQM configuration file on OpenWrt is:

.sp
For simple rate limiting, we are interested in setting the desired interface and the download/upload rates.
.sp
We may also want to optimize for the type of Internet feed and change the qdisc.
.sp
A typical Internet feed could range from a high speed fiber optic connection through fast VDSL to a fairly poor ADSL connection and configured rates should be carefully chosen when setting up your Captive Portal.
.sp
A typical Captive Portal however will be providing free Internet access to customers and guests at a business or venue, using their mobile devices.
.sp
A good compromise for a business or venue might be a download rate from the Internet of ~3000 Kb/s and an upload rate to the Internet of ~1000 Kb/s will be adequate, allowing for example, a client to stream a YouTube video, yet have minimal effect on other clients browsing the Internet or downloading their emails. Obviously the values for upload and download rates for best overall performance depend on many factors and are best determined by trial and error.
.sp
If we assume we have NDS bound to interface br\-lan and we have a VDSL connection, a good working setup for SQM will be as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIRate to\fP Internet 1000 Kb/s (but note this is from the perspective of the interface SQM is monitoring, so this means DOWNLOAD from the client).
.IP \(bu 2
\fIRate from\fP Internet 3000 Kb/s (also note this is from the perspective of the interface SQM is monitoring, so is means UPLOAD to the client).
.IP \(bu 2
\fIVDSL\fP connection (usually an ethernet like connection)
.IP \(bu 2
\fINDS\fP bound to br\-lan
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

We will configure this by issuing the following commands:

\fINote the reversed "upload" and "download" values.\fP

Some broadband providers use variations on the values shown here, contacting them for details sometimes helps but often the request will be "off script" for a typical helpdesk.

.UNINDENT
.sp
For more options, run ndsctl \-h. (Note that if you want the effect of ndsctl commands to to persist across nodogsplash restarts, you have to edit the configuration file.)
.SH CUSTOMISING NODOGSPLASH
.sp
After initial installation, NoDogSplash (NDS) should be working in its most basic mode and client Captive Portal Detection (CPD) should pop up the default splash page.
.sp
Before attempting to customise NDS you should ensure it is working in this basic mode before you start.
.sp
NDS reads its configuration file when it starts up but the location of this file varies depending on the operating system.
.sp
As NDS is a package that requires hardware configured as an IP router, perhaps the most common installation is using OpenWrt. However NDS can be compiled to run on most Linux distributions, the most common being Debian or one of its popular variants (eg Raspbian).
.sp
If NDS is working in the default, post installation mode, then you will have met the NDS dependencies and can now move on to your own customisation.
.SS Rules for Customised Splash Pages
.sp
It should be noted when designing a custom splash page that for security reasons many client device CPD implementations:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Immediately close the browser when the client has authenticated.
.IP \(bu 2

.SS The Configuration File
.sp
In OpenWrt, or operating systems supporting UCI (such as LEDE) the configuration is kept in the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB/etc/config/nodogsplash\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In other operating systems the configuration is kept in the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB/etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Both of these files contain a full list of options and can be edited directly. A restart of NDS is required for any changes to take effect.
.sp
In the case of OpenWrt though, once you are confident in your configuration requirements you can use UCI to read and set any of the configuration options using simple commands, making this very convenient if making changes from scripts, such as those you may write to use with Binauth and FAS.
.sp
For example, to list the full configuration, at the command line type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
uci show nodogsplash
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To display the Gateway Name, type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
uci get nodogsplash.@nodogsplash[0].gatewayname
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To set the Gateway Name to a new value, type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
uci set nodogsplash.@nodogsplash[0].gatewayname=\(aqmy new gateway\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To add a new firewall rule allowing access to another service running on port 8888 on the router, type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
uci add_list nodogsplash.@nodogsplash[0].users_to_router=\(aqallow
tcp port 8888\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally you must tell UCI to commit your changes to the configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
uci commit nodogsplash
.ft P
.fi

.SH TODO LIST
.sp
Not all features are finished or working as properly or as efficiently as they should. Other features have not been thought of yet!
.sp
Features should be aimed at providing tools to allow NDS to be used as flexible Captive Portal engine, rather than building in specific solutions.
.sp
Here is a list of things that need to be improved:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
While (un\-) block/trust/allow via the ndsctl tool take effect, the state object of the client in NDS is not affected.
.sp
Both systems still need to be connected (in src/auth.c).
.IP \(bu 2
Include blocked and trusted clients in the client list \- so that they can be managed.
.IP \(bu 2
Extend Status processing to display a page when a user\(aqs authentication is rejected, e.g. because the user exceeded a quota or is blocked etc.
.IP \(bu 2
Implement Traffic control on a user by user basis. This functionality was originally available but has been broken for many years.
.IP \(bu 2
The code in src/http_microhttpd.c has evolved from previous versions and possibly has some missed edge cases. It would benefit from a rewrite to improve maintainability as well as performance.
.IP \(bu 2
ip version 6 is not currently supported by NDS. It is not essential or advantageous to have in the short term but should be added at some time in the future.
.IP \(bu 2
Automatic Offline mode. Either for forced offline use, or automatic detection of a failed Internet feed could be implemented. Some thought and discussion has been put into this and it is quite possible to achieve.
