  # Set to 0 to disable nodogsplash

  # Set to 0 to disable hook that makes nodogsplash restart when the firewall restarts.
  # This hook is needed as a restart of Firewall overwrites nodogsplash iptables entries.

  # GatewayPort
  # Default: 2050
  #
  # Nodogsplash's own http server uses gateway address as its IP address.
  # The port it listens to at that IP can be set here; default is 2050.

  # The interval in seconds at which nodogsplash checks client timeout status
  option checkinterval '600'

  # Enable BinAuth Support.
  # If set, a program is called with several parameters on authentication (request) and deauthentication.
  # Request for authentication:
  # $<BinAuth> auth_client <client_mac> '<username>' '<password>'
  #
  # The username and password values may be empty strings and are URL encoded.
  # The program is expected to output the number of seconds the client
  # is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the authentification request
  # to be rejected. The same goes for an exit code that is not 0.
  # The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
  # <seconds> <upload> <download>
  #
  # Called on authentication or deauthentication:
  # $<BinAuth> <*auth|*deauth> <incoming_bytes> <outgoing_bytes> <session_start> <session_end>
  #
  # "client_auth": Client authenticated via this script.
  # "client_deauth": Client deauthenticated by the client via splash page.
  # "idle_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because of inactivity.
  # "timeout_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because the session timed out.
  # "ndsctl_auth": Client was authenticated manually by the ndsctl tool.
  # "ndsctl_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by the ndsctl tool.
  # "shutdown_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by Nodogsplash terminating.
  #
  # Values session_start and session_start are in seconds since 1970 or 0 for unknown/unlimited.
  #
  #option binauth '/bin/myauth.sh'

  # Enable Forwarding Authentication Service (FAS)
  # If set redirection is changed from splash.html to a FAS (provided by the system administrator)
  # The value is the IP port number of the FAS
  # Note: if FAS is running locally (ie fasremoteip is NOT set), port 80 cannot be used.
  #
  # Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example:
  #option fasport '80'
  #
  # Typical Locally Hosted example (ie fasremoteip not set):
  #option fasport '2080'

  # Option: fasremoteip
  # Default: GatewayAddress (the IP of NDS)
  # If set, this is the remote ip address of the FAS.
  #
  # Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example:
  #option fasremoteip '46.32.240.41'

  # Option: faspath
  # Default: /
  # This is the path from the FAS Web Root to the FAS login page
  # (not the file system root).
  #
  # Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example:
  #option faspath '/onboard-wifi.net/nodog/fas.php'
  #
  # Typical Locally Hosted example (ie fasremoteip not set):
  #option faspath '/nodog/fas.php'

  # Option: fas_secure_enabled
  # Default: 1
  # If set to "1", authaction and the client token are not revealed and it is the responsibility
  # of the FAS to request the token from NDSCTL.
  # If set to "0", the client token is sent to the FAS in clear text in the query string of the
  # redirect along with authaction and redir.
  #option fas_secure_enabled '0'

  # Enable PreAuth Support.
  #
  # A simple login script is provided in the package.
  # This generates a login page asking for usename and email address.
  # User logins are recorded in the log file /tmp/ndslog.log
  # Details of how the script works are contained in comments in the script itself.
  #
  # PreAuth support allows FAS to call a local program or script with html served by NDS
  # If set, a program/script is called by the NDS FAS handler when:
  # 1. fasremopteip is not set,
  # 2. fasport is set to the gateway port
  # 3. faspath is set to /nodogsplash_preauth/
  #
  # Initially FAS appends its query string to faspath.
  #
  # The Preauth program will output html code that will be served to the client by NDS
  # Using html GET the Preauth program may call:
  # /nodogsplash_preauth/ to ask the client for more information
  # or
  # /nodogsplash_auth/ to authenticate the client
  #
  # The Preauth program should append at least the client ip to the query string
  # (using html input type hidden) for all calls to /nodogsplash_preauth/
  # It must also obtain the client token using ndsctl (or the original query string if fas_secure_enabled=0)
  # for NDS authentication when calling /nodogsplash_auth/
  #

  # Enable username/emailaddress login.
  # Note: fasport must be set to the same value as gatewayport (default = 2050)
  # Enable by uncommenting the following three lines
  #option fasport '2050'
  #option faspath '/nodogsplash_preauth/'
  #option preauth '/usr/lib/nodogsplash/login.sh'

  # Your router may have several interfaces, and you
  # probably want to keep them private from the gatewayinterface.
  # If so, you should block the entire subnets on those interfaces, e.g.:
  #list authenticated_users 'block to 192.168.0.0/16'
  #list authenticated_users 'block to 10.0.0.0/8'

  # Typical ports you will probably want to open up.

  #list authenticated_users 'allow tcp port 53'
  #list authenticated_users 'allow udp port 53'
  #list authenticated_users 'allow tcp port 80'
  #list authenticated_users 'allow tcp port 443'
  # Or for happy customers allow all
  list authenticated_users 'allow all'

  # For preauthenticated users to resolve IP addresses in their
  # initial request not using the router itself as a DNS server,
  # Leave commented to help prevent DNS tunnelling
  #list preauthenticated_users 'allow tcp port 53'
  #list preauthenticated_users 'allow udp port 53'

  # Allow ports for SSH/Telnet/DNS/DHCP/HTTP/HTTPS

  list users_to_router 'allow tcp port 53'
  list users_to_router 'allow udp port 53'
  list users_to_router 'allow udp port 67'
  list users_to_router 'allow tcp port 80'

  # Value is either 'allow' or 'block'. The allowedmac or blockedmac list is used.
  #option macmechanism 'allow'
