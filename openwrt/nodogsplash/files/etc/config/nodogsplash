	# NoDogSplash comes preconfigured for two basic modes of operation
	# A default preauth login script, requiring username and email address to be entered.
	# and
	# A default static splash page (splash.html) with template variables and click to continue
	#
	# 0: Use static splash page or FAS config options
	# 1: Use default preauth login script
	#
	# The default preauth login script is installed as part of the NoDogSplash package providing
	# username/emailaddress login as an alternative to the basic splash page.
	#
	# It generates a login page asking for username and email address.
	# User logins are recorded in the log file /tmp/ndslog.log
	# Details of how the script works are contained in comments in the script itself.
	#
	# Both modes may be customised or a full custom system can be developed using FAS and BinAuth
	# See documentation at: https://nodogsplashdocs.readthedocs.io/

	# MHD has a built in unescape function that urldecodes incoming queries from browsers
	# This option allows an external unescape script to be enabled

	# A standard unescape.sh script is installed by default

	# Request for authentication:
	# $<BinAuth> auth_client <client_mac> '<username>' '<password>'
	#
	# The username and password values may be empty strings and are URL encoded.
	# The program is expected to output the number of seconds the client
	# is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the authentification request
	# to be rejected. The same goes for an exit code that is not 0.
	# The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
	# <seconds> <upload> <download>
	#
	# Called on authentication or deauthentication:
	# $<BinAuth> <*auth|*deauth> <incoming_bytes> <outgoing_bytes> <session_start> <session_end>
	#
	# "client_auth": Client authenticated via this script.
	# "client_deauth": Client deauthenticated by the client via splash page.
	# "idle_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because of inactivity.
	# "timeout_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because the session timed out.
	# "ndsctl_auth": Client was authenticated manually by the ndsctl tool.
	# "ndsctl_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by the ndsctl tool.
	# "shutdown_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by Nodogsplash terminating.
	#
	# Values session_start and session_start are in seconds since 1970 or 0 for unknown/unlimited.

	# Enable Forwarding Authentication Service (FAS)
	# If set redirection is changed from splash.html to a FAS (provided by the system administrator)
	# The value is the IP port number of the FAS
	# Note: if FAS is running locally (ie fasremoteip is NOT set), port 80 cannot be used.
	#
	# Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example:
	#option fasport '80'
	#
	# Typical Locally Hosted example (ie fasremoteip not set):
	#option fasport '2080'

	# Option: fasremotefqdn
	# Default: Not set
	# If set, this is the remote fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the FAS.
	# The protocol must NOT be prepended to the FQDN (ie http:// or https://)
	# To prevent CPD or browser security errors NDS prepends http:// before redirection.
	# If set, DNS MUST resolve fasremotefqdn to be the same ip address as fasremoteip.
	# Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example:
	#option fasremotefqdn 'onboard-wifi.net'

	# Option: fasremoteip
	# Default: GatewayAddress (the IP of NDS)
	# If set, this is the remote ip address of the FAS.
	#
	# Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example:
	#option fasremoteip '46.32.240.41'

	# Option: faspath
	# Default: /
	# This is the path from the FAS Web Root to the FAS login page
	# (not the file system root).
	#
	# Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example (if fasremotefqdn is not specified):
	#option faspath '/onboard-wifi.net/nodog/fas.php'
	#
	# Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example (ie BOTH fasremoteip AND fasremotefqdn set):
	#option faspath '/nodog/fas.php'
	#
	# Typical Locally Hosted Example (ie fasremoteip not set):
	#option faspath '/nodog/fas.php'

	# Option: faskey
	# Default: not set
	# A key phrase for NDS to encrypt the query string sent to FAS
	# Can be any combination of A-Z, a-z and 0-9, up to 16 characters with no white space
	#option faskey '1234567890'

	# Option: fas_secure_enabled
	# Default: 1
	#
	# ****If set to "0"****
	# the client token is sent to the FAS in clear text in the query string of the
	# redirect along with authaction and redir.
	#
	# ****If set to "1" and option faskey is NOT set****
	# authaction and the client token are not revealed and it is the responsibility
	# of the FAS to request the token from NDSCTL.
	#
	# ****If set to "1" and option faskey IS set****
	# The client token will be hashed and sent to the FAS identified as “hid” in the query string.
	# The gatewayaddress is also sent on the query string, allowing the FAS to construct the authaction parameter.
	# FAS must return the sha256sum of the concatenation of the original hid and faskey, to be used by NDS for client authentication.
	# This is returned in the normal way in the query string identified as “tok”.
	# NDS will automatically detect whether hid mode is active or the raw token is being returned.
	# Should sha256sum not be available to NDS when faskey is set, NDS will exit gracefully, logging the error in syslog.
	#
	# *****If set to 2****
	# clientip, clientmac, gatewayname, client token, gatewayaddress, authdir, originurl and clientif
	# are encrypted using faskey and passed to FAS in the query string.
	# The query string will also contain a randomly generated initialization vector to be used by the FAS for decryption.
	# The "php-cli" package and the "php-openssl" module must both be installed for fas_secure level 2.
	# Nodogsplash does not depend on this package and module, but will exit gracefully
	# if this package and module are not installed when this level is set, logging the error in syslog.
	# The FAS must use the query string passed initialisation vector and the pre shared fas_key to decrypt the query string.
	# An example FAS php script is supplied in the source code.
	#
	#option fas_secure_enabled '0'

	# PreAuth
	# PreAuth support allows FAS to call a local program or script with html served by the built in NDS web server
	# If the option is set, it points to a program/script that is called by the NDS FAS handler
	# All other FAS settings will be overidden.
	# Initially FAS appends its query string to faspath.
	# The Preauth program will output html code that will be served to the client by NDS
	# Using html GET the Preauth program may call:
	# /nodogsplash_preauth/ to ask the client for more information
	# or
	# /nodogsplash_auth/ to authenticate the client
	#
	# The Preauth program should append at least the client ip to the query string
	# (using html input type hidden) for all calls to /nodogsplash_preauth/
	# It must also obtain the client token (using ndsctl), for NDS authentication when calling /nodogsplash_auth/
	#
	#option preauth '/path/to/myscript/myscript.sh'


	# Your router may have several interfaces, and you
	# probably want to keep them private from the gatewayinterface.
