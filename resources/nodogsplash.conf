#
# Nodogsplash Configuration File
#

# Parameter: GatewayInterface
# Default: NONE
#
# GatewayInterface is not autodetected, has no default, and must be set here.
# Set GatewayInterface to the interface on your router
# that is to be managed by Nodogsplash.
# Typically br-lan for the wired and wireless lan.
#
GatewayInterface br-lan

# Parameter: WebRoot
# Default: /etc/nodogsplash/htdocs
#
# The local path where the splash page content resides.

# FirewallRuleSet: authenticated-users
#
# Control access for users after authentication.
# These rules are inserted at the beginning of the
# FORWARD chain of the router's filter table, and
# apply to packets that have come in to the router
# over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# have authenticated with Nodogsplash, and that are
# destined to be routed through the router.  The rules are
# considered in order, and the first rule that matches
# a packet applies to it.
# If there are any rules in this ruleset, an authenticated
# packet that does not match any rule is rejected.
# N.B.: This ruleset is completely independent of
# the preauthenticated-users ruleset.
#
FirewallRuleSet authenticated-users {

# You may want to open access to a machine on a local
# subnet that is otherwise blocked (for example, to
# serve a redirect page; see RedirectURL).  If so,
# allow that explicitly here, e.g:
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 192.168.254.254

# Your router may have several interfaces, and you
# probably want to keep them private from the GatewayInterface.
# If so, you should block the entire subnets on those interfaces, e.g.:
#  FirewallRule block to 192.168.0.0/16
#  FirewallRule block to 10.0.0.0/8

# Typical ports you will probably want to open up include
# 53 udp and tcp for DNS,
# 80 for http,
# 443 for https,
# 22 for ssh:
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 53	
#  FirewallRule allow udp port 53	
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 80
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 443
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 22
# Or for happy customers allow all
  FirewallRule allow all
# You might use ipset to easily allow/block range of ips, e.g.: 
# FirewallRule allow ipset WHITELISTED_IPS
# FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 ipset WHITELISTED_IPS
}
# end FirewallRuleSet authenticated-users


# FirewallRuleSet: preauthenticated-users
#
# Control access for users before authentication.
# These rules are inserted in the PREROUTING chain
# of the router's nat table, and in the
# FORWARD chain of the router's filter table.
# These rules apply to packets that have come in to the 
# router over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# are not on the BlockedMACList or TrustedMACList,
# are *not* authenticated with Nodogsplash.  The rules are
# considered in order, and the first rule that matches
# a packet applies to it. A packet that does not match 
# any rule here is rejected.
# N.B.: This ruleset is completely independent of
# the authenticated-users and users-to-router rulesets.
#
FirewallRuleSet preauthenticated-users {
# For preauthenticated users to resolve IP addresses in their
# initial request not using the router itself as a DNS server.
# Leave commented to help prevent DNS tunnelling
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 53	
#  FirewallRule allow udp port 53
#
# For splash page content not hosted on the router, you
# will want to allow port 80 tcp to the remote host here.
# Doing so circumvents the usual capture and redirect of
# any port 80 request to this remote host.
# Note that the remote host's numerical IP address must be known
# and used here.  
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 123.321.123.321
}
# end FirewallRuleSet preauthenticated-users


# FirewallRuleSet: users-to-router
#
# Control access to the router itself from the GatewayInterface.
# These rules are inserted at the beginning of the
# INPUT chain of the router's filter table, and
# apply to packets that have come in to the router
# over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# are not on the TrustedMACList, and are destined for
# the router itself.  The rules are
# considered in order, and the first rule that matches
# a packet applies to it. 
# If there are any rules in this ruleset, a
# packet that does not match any rule is rejected.
#
FirewallRuleSet users-to-router {

 # at GatewayAddress, to serve the splash page.
 # However you may want to open up other ports, e.g.
 # 53 for DNS and 67 for DHCP if the router itself is
 # providing these services.
    FirewallRule allow udp port 53	
    FirewallRule allow tcp port 53	
    FirewallRule allow udp port 67
 # You may want to allow ssh, http, and https to the router
 # for administration from the GatewayInterface.  If not,

# EmptyRuleSetPolicy directives
# The FirewallRuleSets that NoDogSplash permits are:
#
# authenticated-users
# preauthenticated-users
# users-to-router
# trusted-users
# trusted-users-to-router
#
# For each of these, an EmptyRuleSetPolicy can be specified.
# An EmptyRuleSet policy applies to a FirewallRuleSet if the
# FirewallRuleSet is missing from this configuration file,
# or if it exists but contains no FirewallRules.
#
# The possible values of an EmptyRuleSetPolicy are:
# allow  -- packets are accepted
# block  -- packets are rejected
# passthrough -- packets are passed through to pre-existing firewall rules
#
# Default EmptyRuleSetPolicies are set as follows:
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy authenticated-users passthrough
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy preauthenticated-users block
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy users-to-router block
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users allow
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users-to-router allow


# Parameter: GatewayName
# Default: NoDogSplash
#
# Set  GatewayName to the name of your gateway.  This value

# and in status output from ndsctl, but otherwise doesn't matter.
# If none is supplied, the value "NoDogSplash" is used.
#
# GatewayName NoDogSplash

# Parameter: GatewayAddress
# Default: Discovered from GatewayInterface
#
# This should be autodetected on an OpenWRT system, but if not:
# Set GatewayAddress to the IP address of the router on
# the GatewayInterface.  This is the address that the Nodogsplash
# server listens on.
#
# GatewayAddress 192.168.1.1

# Parameter: StatusPage
# Default: status.html
#
# The page the client is show if the client is already authenticated but navigates to the captive portal.

# The page the client is redirected to if not authenticated or whitelisted.
#
# SplashPage splash.html

# Parameter: RedirectURL
# Default: none
#
# After authentication, normally a user is redirected 
# to their initially requested page. 
# If RedirectURL is set, the user is redirected to this URL instead.
# 
# RedirectURL http://www.ilesansfil.org/

# Parameter: GatewayPort
# Default: 2050
#
# Nodogsplash's own http server uses GatewayAddress as its IP address.
# The port it listens to at that IP can be set here; default is 2050.
#
# GatewayPort 2050

# Parameter: MaxClients
# Default: 20
#
# Set MaxClients to the maximum number of users allowed to 
# connect at any time.  (Does not include users on the TrustedMACList,
# who do not authenticate.)
#
  MaxClients 250

# Parameter: SessionTimeout
# Default: 0
#
# Set the default session length in minutes. A value of 0 is for
# sessions without an end.
#

# Parameter: PreAuthIdleTimeout
# Default: 10
#
# Set PreAuthIdleTimeout to the desired number of minutes before
# an pre-authenticated user is automatically removed from the client list.
#

# Parameter: AuthIdleTimeout
# Default: 120
#
# Set AuthIdleTimeout to the desired number of minutes before
# an authenticated user is automatically 'deauthenticated'
# and removed from the client list.
#

# Parameter: CheckInterval
# Default: 30
#
# Interval in seconds (!) the timeouts of all clients are checked.
#

# Parameter: MACMechanism
# Default: block
#
# Either block or allow.
# If 'block', MAC addresses on BlockedMACList are blocked from
# authenticating, and all others are allowed.
# If 'allow', MAC addresses on AllowedMACList are allowed to
# authenticate, and all other (non-trusted) MAC's are blocked.
#
# MACMechanism block

# Parameter: BlockedMACList
# Default: none
#
# Comma-separated list of MAC addresses who will be completely blocked
# from the GatewayInterface. Ignored if MACMechanism is allow.
# N.B.: weak security, since MAC addresses are easy to spoof.
#
# BlockedMACList 00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF,00:00:C0:1D:F0:0D

# Parameter: AllowedMACList
# Default: none
#
# Comma-separated list of MAC addresses who will not be completely
# blocked from the GatewayInterface. Ignored if MACMechanism is block.
# N.B.: weak security, since MAC addresses are easy to spoof.
#
# AllowedMACList 00:00:12:34:56:78

# Parameter: TrustedMACList
# Default: none
#
# Comma-separated list of MAC addresses who are not subject to
# authentication, and are not restricted by any FirewallRuleSet.

# Default: no
#
# Set to yes (or true or 1), to enable traffic control in Nodogsplash.
#
# TrafficControl no

# Parameter: DownloadLimit
# Default: 0
#
# If TrafficControl is enabled, this sets the maximum download
# speed to the GatewayInterface, in kilobits per second.
# For example if you have an ADSL connection with 768 kbit
# download speed, and you want to allow about half of that
# bandwidth for the GatewayInterface, set this to 384.
# A value of 0 means no download limiting is done.
#
# DownloadLimit 384

# Parameter: UploadLimit
# Default: 0
#
# If TrafficControl is enabled, this sets the maximum upload
# speed from the GatewayInterface, in kilobits per second.
# For example if you have an ADSL connection with 128 kbit
# upload speed, and you want to allow about half of that
# bandwidth for the GatewayInterface, set this to 64.
# A value of 0 means no upload limiting is done.
#
# UploadLimit 64

# Parameter: GatewayIPRange
# Default: 0.0.0.0/0
#
# By setting this parameter, you can specify a range of IP addresses
# on the GatewayInterface that will be responded to and managed by
# Nodogsplash.  Addresses outside this range do not have their packets
# touched by Nodogsplash at all.
# Defaults to 0.0.0.0/0, that is, all addresses.
#

#
# or this one for Debian and other Linux distributions
# preauth '/etc/nodogsplash/login.sh'

# Parameter: BinAuth
#
# Enable BinAuth Support.
# If set, a program is called with several parameters on authentication (request) and deauthentication.
#
# Request for authentication:
#
# $<BinAuth> auth_client <client_mac> '<username>' '<password>'
#
# The username and password values may be empty strings and are URL encoded.
# The program is expected to output the number of seconds the client
# is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the authentification request
# to be rejected. The same goes for an exit code that is not 0.
# The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
# <seconds> <upload> <download>
#
# Called on authentication or deauthentication:
# $<BinAuth> <*auth|*deauth> <incoming_bytes> <outgoing_bytes> <session_start> <session_end>
#
# "client_auth": Client authenticated via this script.
# "client_deauth": Client deauthenticated by the client via splash page.
# "idle_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because of inactivity.
# "timeout_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because the session timed out.
# "ndsctl_auth": Client was authenticated manually by the ndsctl tool.
# "ndsctl_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by the ndsctl tool.
# "shutdown_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by Nodogsplash terminating.
#
# Values session_start and session_start are in seconds since 1970 or 0 for unknown/unlimited.
#
# BinAuth /bin/myauth.sh

# Nodogsplash uses specific HEXADECIMAL values to mark packets used by iptables as a bitwise mask.
# This mask can conflict with the requirements of other packages such as mwan3, sqm etc
# Any values set here are interpreted as in hex format.
#
# Parameter: fw_mark_authenticated
# Default: 30000 (0011|0000|0000|0000|0000 binary)
#
# Parameter: fw_mark_trusted
# Default: 20000 (0010|0000|0000|0000|0000 binary)
#
# Parameter: fw_mark_blocked
# Default: 10000 (0001|0000|0000|0000|0000 binary)
