# Nodogsplash Configuration File
#

# Option: GatewayInterface
# Default: NONE
#
# GatewayInterface is not autodetected, has no default, and must be set here.
# Set GatewayInterface to the interface on your router
# that is to be managed by Nodogsplash.
# Typically br-lan for the wired and wireless lan.
#
GatewayInterface br-lan

# Login Option
# Default: 0
#
# NoDogSplash comes preconfigured for two basic modes of operation
# A default preauth login script, requiring username and email address to be entered.
# and
# A default static splash page (splash.html) with template variables and click to continue
#
# 0: Use static splash page or FAS config options
# 1: Use default preauth login script
#
# The default preauth login script is installed as part of the NoDogSplash package providing
# username/emailaddress login as an alternative to the basic splash page.
#
# It generates a login page asking for username and email address.
# User logins are recorded in the log file /tmp/ndslog.log
# Details of how the script works are contained in comments in the script itself.
#
# Both modes may be customised or a full custom system can be developed using FAS and BinAuth
# See documentation at: https://nodogsplashdocs.readthedocs.io/
#
login_option_enabled 0

# Use outdated libmicrohttpd (MHD)
# Older versions of MHD convert & and + characters to spaces when present in form data
# This can make a PreAuth or BinAuth impossible to use for a client if form data contains either of these characters
# eg. in username or password
# MHD versions earlier than 0.9.69 are detected.
# If this option is set to 0 (default), NDS will terminate if MHD is earlier than 0.9.69
# If this option is set to 1, NDS will start but log an error.
use_outdated_mhd 0

# MHD Unescape callback
# MHD has a built in unescape function that urldecodes incoming queries from browsers
# This option allows an external unescape script to be enabled
# The script must be named unescape.sh, be present in /usr/lib/nodogsplash/ and be executable.
# A standard unescape.sh script is installed by default
# Set to 1 to enable this option, 0 to disable
# default is disabled
#

# FirewallRuleSet: authenticated-users
#
# Control access for users after authentication.
# These rules are inserted at the beginning of the
# FORWARD chain of the router's filter table, and
# apply to packets that have come in to the router
# over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# have authenticated with Nodogsplash, and that are
# destined to be routed through the router.  The rules are
# considered in order, and the first rule that matches
# a packet applies to it.
# If there are any rules in this ruleset, an authenticated
# packet that does not match any rule is rejected.
# N.B.: This ruleset is completely independent of
# the preauthenticated-users ruleset.
#

# You may want to open access to a machine on a local
# subnet that is otherwise blocked (for example, to
# serve a redirect page; see RedirectURL).  If so,
# allow that explicitly here, e.g:
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 192.168.254.254

# Your router may have several interfaces, and you
# probably want to keep them private from the GatewayInterface.
# If so, you should block the entire subnets on those interfaces, e.g.:
#  FirewallRule block to 192.168.0.0/16
#  FirewallRule block to 10.0.0.0/8

# Typical ports you will probably want to open up include
# 53 udp and tcp for DNS,
# 80 for http,
# 443 for https,
# 22 for ssh:
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 53	
#  FirewallRule allow udp port 53	
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 80
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 443
#  FirewallRule allow tcp port 22
# Or for happy customers allow all

# FirewallRule allow ipset WHITELISTED_IPS
# FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 ipset WHITELISTED_IPS

# These rules apply to packets that have come in to the 
# router over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# are not on the BlockedMACList or TrustedMACList,
# are *not* authenticated with Nodogsplash.  The rules are

# EmptyRuleSetPolicy directives
# The FirewallRuleSets that NoDogSplash permits are:
#
# authenticated-users
# preauthenticated-users
# users-to-router
# trusted-users
# trusted-users-to-router
#
# For each of these, an EmptyRuleSetPolicy can be specified.
# An EmptyRuleSet policy applies to a FirewallRuleSet if the
# FirewallRuleSet is missing from this configuration file,
# or if it exists but contains no FirewallRules.
#
# The possible values of an EmptyRuleSetPolicy are:
# allow  -- packets are accepted
# block  -- packets are rejected
# passthrough -- packets are passed through to pre-existing firewall rules
#
# Default EmptyRuleSetPolicies are set as follows:
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy authenticated-users passthrough
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy preauthenticated-users block
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy users-to-router block
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users allow
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users-to-router allow


# Option: GatewayName
# Default: NoDogSplash
#
# Set  GatewayName to the name of your gateway.  This value
# will be available as variable $gatewayname in the splash page source
# and in status output from ndsctl, but otherwise doesn't matter.
# If none is supplied, the value "NoDogSplash" is used.
#
# GatewayName NoDogSplash

# Option: GatewayAddress
# Default: Discovered from GatewayInterface
#
# This should be autodetected on an OpenWRT system, but if not:
# Set GatewayAddress to the IP address of the router on
# the GatewayInterface.  This is the address that the Nodogsplash
# server listens on.
#
# GatewayAddress 192.168.1.1

# Option: StatusPage
# Default: status.html
#
# The page the client is show if the client is already authenticated but navigates to the captive portal.
#
# StatusPage status.html

# Option: SplashPage
# Default: splash.html
#
# The page the client is redirected to if not authenticated or whitelisted.
#
# SplashPage splash.html

# Option: RedirectURL
# Default: none
#
# After authentication, normally a user is redirected 
# to their initially requested page. 
# If RedirectURL is set, the user is redirected to this URL instead.

# NOTE: RedirectURL is deprecated.

#	redirectURL is now redundant as most CPD implementations immediately close the "splash" page
#	as soon as NDS authenticates, thus redirectURL will not be shown.
#
#	This functionality, ie displaying a particular web page as a final "Landing Page",
#	can be achieved reliably using FAS, with NDS calling the previous "redirectURL" as the FAS page.

# 
# RedirectURL http://www.ilesansfil.org/

# Option: GatewayPort
# Default: 2050
#
# Nodogsplash's own http server uses GatewayAddress as its IP address.
# The port it listens to at that IP can be set here; default is 2050.
#
# GatewayPort 2050

# Option: MaxClients
# Default: 20
#
# Set MaxClients to the maximum number of users allowed to 
# connect at any time.  (Does not include users on the TrustedMACList,
# who do not authenticate.)
#
  MaxClients 250

# Option: SessionTimeout
# Default: 0
#
# Set the default session length in minutes. A value of 0 is for
# sessions without an end.
#

# Option: PreAuthIdleTimeout
# Default: 10
#
# Set PreAuthIdleTimeout to the desired number of minutes before
# an pre-authenticated user is automatically removed from the client list.
#

# Option: AuthIdleTimeout
# Default: 120
#
# Set AuthIdleTimeout to the desired number of minutes before
# an authenticated user is automatically 'deauthenticated'
# and removed from the client list.
#

# Option: CheckInterval
# Default: 30
#
# Interval in seconds (!) the timeouts of all clients are checked.
#

# Option: MACMechanism
# Default: block
#
# Either block or allow.
# If 'block', MAC addresses on BlockedMACList are blocked from
# authenticating, and all others are allowed.
# If 'allow', MAC addresses on AllowedMACList are allowed to
# authenticate, and all other (non-trusted) MAC's are blocked.
#
# MACMechanism block

# Option: BlockedMACList
# Default: none
#
# Comma-separated list of MAC addresses who will be completely blocked
# from the GatewayInterface. Ignored if MACMechanism is allow.
# N.B.: weak security, since MAC addresses are easy to spoof.
#
# BlockedMACList 00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF,00:00:C0:1D:F0:0D

# Option: AllowedMACList
# Default: none
#
# Comma-separated list of MAC addresses who will not be completely
# blocked from the GatewayInterface. Ignored if MACMechanism is block.
# N.B.: weak security, since MAC addresses are easy to spoof.
#
# AllowedMACList 00:00:12:34:56:78

# Option: TrustedMACList
# Default: none
#
# Comma-separated list of MAC addresses who are not subject to
# authentication, and are not restricted by any FirewallRuleSet.
# N.B.: weak security, since MAC addresses are easy to spoof.
#
# TrustedMACList 00:00:CA:FE:BA:BE, 00:00:C0:01:D0:0D

# Option: TrafficControl
# Default: no
#
# Set to yes (or true or 1), to enable traffic control in Nodogsplash.
#
# TrafficControl no

# Option: DownloadLimit
# Default: 0
#
# If TrafficControl is enabled, this sets the maximum download
# speed to the GatewayInterface, in kilobits per second.
# For example if you have an ADSL connection with 768 kbit
# download speed, and you want to allow about half of that
# bandwidth for the GatewayInterface, set this to 384.
# A value of 0 means no download limiting is done.
#
# DownloadLimit 384

# Option: UploadLimit
# Default: 0
#
# If TrafficControl is enabled, this sets the maximum upload
# speed from the GatewayInterface, in kilobits per second.
# For example if you have an ADSL connection with 128 kbit
# upload speed, and you want to allow about half of that
# bandwidth for the GatewayInterface, set this to 64.
# A value of 0 means no upload limiting is done.
#
# UploadLimit 64

# Option: GatewayIPRange
# Default: 0.0.0.0/0
#
# By setting this parameter, you can specify a range of IP addresses
# on the GatewayInterface that will be responded to and managed by
# Nodogsplash.  Addresses outside this range do not have their packets
# touched by Nodogsplash at all.
# Defaults to 0.0.0.0/0, that is, all addresses.
#
# GatewayIPRange 0.0.0.0/0

# Option: DebugLevel
# Default: 1
# 0 : Silent (only LOG_ERR and LOG_EMERG messages will be seen, otherwise there will be no logging.)
# 1 : LOG_ERR, LOG_EMERG, LOG_WARNING and LOG_NOTICE (this is the default level).
# 2 : debuglevel 1 + LOG_INFO
# 3 : debuglevel 2 + LOG_DEBUG
# DebugLevel 1

# Option: fasport
# Default: None
#
# Enable Forwarding Authentication Service (FAS)
# If set redirection is changed from splash.html to a FAS (provided by the system administrator)
# The value is the IP port number of the FAS
# Note: if FAS is running locally (ie fasremoteip is NOT set), port 80 cannot be used
#
# Typical remote Hosted Example:
# fasport 80
#
# Typical Locally Hosted Example:
# fasport 2080

# Option: fasremotefqdn
# Default: Not set
# If set, this is the remote fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the FAS.
# The protocol must NOT be prepended to the FQDN (ie http:// or https://)
# To prevent CPD or browser security errors NDS prepends http:// before redirection.
# If set, DNS MUST resolve fasremotefqdn to be the same ip address as fasremoteip.
# Typical Remote Shared Hosting Example:
# fasremotefqdn onboard-wifi.net

# Option: fasremoteip
# Default: GatewayAddress (the IP of NDS)
#
# If set, this is the remote ip address of the FAS.
#
# Typical Locally Hosted example (ie fasremoteip not set):
# fasremoteip 46.32.240.41

# Option: faspath
# Default: /
#
# This is the path from the FAS Web Root to the FAS login page
# (not the file system root).
#
# Typical Shared Hosting example:
# faspath '/onboard-wifi.net/nodog/fas.php'
#
# Typical Locally Hosted example (ie fasremoteip not set):
# faspath /nodog/fas.php


# Option: faskey
# Default: not set
# A key phrase for NDS to encrypt the query string sent to FAS
# Can be any combination of A-Z, a-z and 0-9, up to 16 characters with no white space
#option faskey 1234567890

#
# Option: fas_secure_enabled
# Default: 1
#
# ****If set to "0"****
# the client token is sent to the FAS in clear text in the query string of the
# redirect along with authaction and redir.
#
# ****If set to "1" and option faskey is NOT set****
# authaction and the client token are not revealed and it is the responsibility
# of the FAS to request the token from NDSCTL.
#
# ****If set to "1" and option faskey IS set****
# The client token will be hashed and sent to the FAS identified as “hid” in the query string.
# The gatewayaddress is also sent on the query string, allowing the FAS to construct the authaction parameter.
# FAS must return the sha256sum of the concatenation of the original hid and faskey, to be used by NDS for client authentication.
# This is returned in the normal way in the query string identified as “tok”.
# NDS will automatically detect whether hid mode is active or the raw token is being returned.
# Should sha256sum not be available to NDS when faskey is set, NDS will exit gracefully, logging the error in syslog.
#
# *****If set to 2****
# clientip, clientmac, gatewayname, client token, gatewayaddress, authdir, originurl and clientif
# are encrypted using faskey and passed to FAS in the query string.
# The query string will also contain a randomly generated initialization vector to be used by the FAS for decryption.
# The "php-cli" package and the "php-openssl" module must both be installed for fas_secure level 2.
# Nodogsplash does not depend on this package and module, but will exit gracefully
# if this package and module are not installed when this level is set, logging the error in syslog.
# The FAS must use the query string passed initialisation vector and the pre shared fas_key to decrypt the query string.
# An example FAS php script is supplied in the source code.
#
#fas_secure_enabled 0

# PreAuth
# PreAuth support allows FAS to call a local program or script with html served by the built in NDS web server
# If the option is set, it points to a program/script that is called by the NDS FAS handler
# All other FAS settings will be overidden.
# Initially FAS appends its query string to faspath.
# The Preauth program will output html code that will be served to the client by NDS
# Using html GET the Preauth program may call:
# /nodogsplash_preauth/ to ask the client for more information
# or
# /nodogsplash_auth/ to authenticate the client
#
# The Preauth program should append at least the client ip to the query string
# (using html input type hidden) for all calls to /nodogsplash_preauth/
# It must also obtain the client token (using ndsctl), for NDS authentication when calling /nodogsplash_auth/
#
#preauth /path/to/myscript/myscript.sh

# Option: BinAuth
#
# Enable BinAuth Support.
# If set, a program is called with several parameters on authentication (request) and deauthentication.
#
# Request for authentication:
#
# $<BinAuth> auth_client <client_mac> '<username>' '<password>'
#
# The username and password values may be empty strings and are URL encoded.
# The program is expected to output the number of seconds the client
# is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the authentification request
# to be rejected. The same goes for an exit code that is not 0.
# The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
# <seconds> <upload> <download>
#
# Called on authentication or deauthentication:
# $<BinAuth> <*auth|*deauth> <incoming_bytes> <outgoing_bytes> <session_start> <session_end>
#
# "client_auth": Client authenticated via this script.
# "client_deauth": Client deauthenticated by the client via splash page.
# "idle_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because of inactivity.
# "timeout_deauth": Client was deauthenticated because the session timed out.
# "ndsctl_auth": Client was authenticated manually by the ndsctl tool.
# "ndsctl_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by the ndsctl tool.
# "shutdown_deauth": Client was deauthenticated by Nodogsplash terminating.
#
# Values session_start and session_start are in seconds since 1970 or 0 for unknown/unlimited.
#
# BinAuth /bin/myauth.sh

# Nodogsplash uses specific HEXADECIMAL values to mark packets used by iptables as a bitwise mask.
# This mask can conflict with the requirements of other packages such as mwan3, sqm etc
# Any values set here are interpreted as in hex format.
