/* - special case: empty string returns empty string
 * - on windows or cygwin: replace \ with /
 * - strip leading spaces
 * - prepends "/" if not present already
 * - resolve "/../", "//" and "/./" the usual way:
 *   the first one removes a preceding component, the other two
 *   get compressed to "/".
 * - "/." and "/.." at the end are similar, but always leave a trailing
 *   "/"
 *
 * /blah/..         gets  /
 * /blah/../foo     gets  /foo
 * /abc/./xyz       gets  /abc/xyz
 * /abc//xyz        gets  /abc/xyz
 *
 * NOTE: src and dest can point to the same buffer, in which case,
 *       the operation is performed in-place.
